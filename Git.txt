--? Why is Git Around ??
--> It is a version control sysytem.Software is evolved over a period of time.
    So its important to Track changes.
    Easy file recovery.
    Who introduced an issue when.
    Rollback to previous working state
    

--? History Of VCS 
--> 1.LOCAL VCS
    Pros-Rollback
    Cons-if you lose your HDD everything is lost.

--> 2.CENTRALISED VCS
    Concept of server.

    SERVER ----------FILES PULLED--------->USER
           <---------FILES PUSHED---------

    If server damage data might be lost.

--> 3.DISTRIBUTED VCS(GIT,GITHUB)
        
            SERVER ----------FILES PULLED--------->USER(Have Complete Backup + changes)

(Repository copied)<---------FILES PUSHED---------

    If Server lost client has copy and changes to project.
    

--? How was GIT created?
--> Linus development was done using zip and patches.As linux grew Linus Torvalds
    used BITKEEPER VCS
    
    BITKEEPER ANNOUNCED TO HIKE PRICES IN 2005
    
    SO created GIT
  
    GITHUB IS HOSTING SERVICE FOR GIT.

--? Features of GIT
--> Captures Snapshot not differences.
   .git folder ahs history of whole project
   Almost every operation is local.
   GIT genrally adds data.
   
--? GIT COMMANDS
--> git,git status,git config --global user.name/email "",git config --list
    git config user.name/email,git init,git add --a,git commit -m "",git log
    git add filename,rm -rf .git(deletes . git file not git repository anymore)
    git clone, ls,cd,pwd,touch file name (to crerate new file in dest folder)
    git diff (compares working directory with staging area) git diff--staged
    (compares our last commit to present staging area)
    git commit -a -m ""(directly commits the tracked files without going to staging area)
    git rm folder name (removed the folder and directly stages),git mv OLD file name New file name
    (chnages the nam of file from old to new),git rm --cached filename,git log -p(shows waht is committees and changesmade
    git log --stat(summary of commits),git log --pretty=one line/short/full(shows all commits in one line),git log --since=2.days/months/weeks
    (give all commits for days months or weeks),git log --pretty=format:(search for git scm useful options for git
    in google various options after format is used to sort the commits on different basis),git commit --amend
    (used to add the changes to last commit or add changes to last commit),
    git restore --staged file name (to instage file from staging area),git checkout -- filename
    git checkout -f(brings u back to last commited stage the changes you made will lost)
    git remote,git push -u origin master,git config --global alias.newname old command name
    (if you want git status as git st do alias),git checkout -b branchname(switches to new
    branch),git checkout master(to go back to master branch),git branch (shows all branches)
    git merge branch name to be merged with master,git branch -v(gives commit hash branches commit msgs)
    git branch --merged(shows all branches we have merged already),git branch --no-merged(not already merged branches)
    git branch -d branch name(gives warning when branch is not merged merged branch will get deleted otherwise..warns)
    and do git branch -D branch name in next step for non merged,git origin branchname
    (in git the the added brranch to master is not pushed automatically to github,so we 
    explicitly got to that branch and run this command,stay in branch you want to push)
    git push -d branchname (to delete branch from github thta being pushed)

    

    
    
    





--? LOCAL OPERATIONS
--> WORKING DIRECTORY -----STAGING AREA-----GIT REPOSITORY
    ---------------Staging area----->-------Commit------->
    <--------------------CHECKOUT THE PROJECT------------- 

    When we stage it means we are ready to commit


--? File Operations
--> untracked-----(add the file)--->unmodified-----(edit the file)----->modified------(stage the file)------>staged
             <-----(remove the file)----------|<--------------------------(commit)---------------------------------|    
   
         
--? How to ignore a file you dont want to commit?
--> use .gitignore and add that file name into that and save !
    the file name added in .gitignore wont be tracked now 
    If you have multiple files then do this in .git ignore file
    *.(extension file you dont want to track)
    if i want to ignore whole directory do this in .gitignore
    foldername/
    Git by default ignores blank folder
--? Git Diff
--> It compares working directory with staging area ie 
    what i did i made changes to a folder and did git add --a
    this folder is in staging area
    now i again make changes to it and save it and run git status
    it show that this file is not tracked (in red)
    therefore there are two versions of this file one in staging area and other in 
    working directory so git diff tells about the changes of both areas

--? Git -a -m ""
--> It directly adds TRACKED files to commit without going to staging area
    if file is not TRACKED it cannot be sent directly to commit

--? git rm --cached file name
--> If a file is already tracked assume to.exel now i added this file to gitignore 
    so if i now run git status it will show changes made in gitignore so i commit it
    now if i make changes to to.exel it must not reflect in bash but when i make changes to 
    this file and check bash i see it shows changs made to to.exel so i have to 
    remove the track of git to this file which was alreading tracking it using this command 
    ***WE HAVE TO EXPLICITLY UNTRACK IT***

--? Git checkout --filename
--> If you have made changes to a file or deleted its content now if u say git status 
    it will show modified but by mistake u made changes and want ot get back to it
    use this command this command will bring your file to last commited stage and will 
    restore it last committed changes and the working tree gets cleaned ie committed.

--? Pull Vs Push
--> PULL brings code from github to our PC  while PUSH is used to put files from pc to 
    Github

--? Branching of git
--> Branching in git is used to do parallel work from master branch the changes in the new branch 
    do not reflect to master until we want to.If i make changes into the new branch ie deleted some files from the 
    folder which is being tracked after switching to main branch ill get those folders back without any changes to
    the main branch folder.
    Branch is not pushed to github automatically we have to push it.
                           
                           |(branch name =develop)----o----o
                           |
   (Master)o----o----o----<-----o----o------o
                           |
                           |(branch name =hello)-------o----o----o----o


--? Merge Conflicts
--> These arise when we merge a branch to master and our git asks about some changes
    that requires users attention to be included ie git isnt able to merge it.
    git add file name is used to mark merge conflicts.
    after merge conflict is resolved a new commit is added with selected changes into main branch
   
    If youre chnging the branch the branch youre leaving should be clean ie nothing remain to be committeed

--?Branching Workflow
--> 1. Long Running---> stay till project goes on (master ,develop,idea)

    2. Topic Branches---> Ends when a topic is completed and integrated.

## Some more commands with explaination
1. git restore --staged file_name : Done to change file back into the staging(untracked files) i.e after git add it revert back to git status.
2. git reset last_3rd_commit_id : wish to remove any specific commit from git log/history.Commits are build one over the other if you want to delete last 2 commits then copy the commit id of last 3rd commit. Now the first 2 commit files changes are in the staging area.
3. git remote -v : shows all the urls attached to the folder.
4. git merge branch_name - to merge branch into other.
5. git remote add upstream url : from where you have forked the project is known as Upstream url by convention. This is done when we want to contribute to the project and fork it and make changes in local i.e Open Source Contribution. Origin is your personal.
6. git fetch --all --prune : fetch all the commit from the upstream(remote) branch and also fetch the deleted commits(prune)
7. git reset --hard upstream/main : reset to the main branch of upstream so that we can maintain the remote main with our repo(local) main and see the commits that are being added to the main of the upstream.
8. then do - git push origin main : to make changes to our main branch.
9. git pull upstream main : is same as steo from 6-8. Basically, pull = fetch + merge
10. git rebase -i commit_id : above which you aregoing to merge all the commits in a one single commit
pick d8279dd8 1
s vw13414hw 2 --> s stands for squish
s g234wu453 3
pick s53265 4 --> pick means I am taking this commmit.
then use :x to mention the message for new commit.
==> the first three commit will be merge to commit 1 and 4th commit is treated as individual commit.
